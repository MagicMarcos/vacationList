# Vacation List

<p>A front end app, that helps track your vacation wish list.</p>

## Reflections and Descrition:

<p>This relatively simple app, was a great refresher of core HTML, CSS and JS concepts.</p>
<p>Getting to work with bootstrap is always super intuitive and easy.</p>
<p>Additionally, this was a great exercise in building modules, working with browser storage, momentJS, and the Unsplash API</p>

## Todo:

<p>Squash some bugs, add a live counting feature to edited, instead of just the date.</p>
